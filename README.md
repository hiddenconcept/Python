## 🔐 Security Utilities

A collection of Python-based tools focused on penetration testing and cybersecurity. These scripts are built to demonstrate an understanding of common security concepts including network scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability analysis.

**Topics covered:**
- Network scanning & enumeration
- Port scanning
- Packet analysis
- Exploit scripting fundamentals

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** All tools in this folder are intended for **educational purposes only**. Only use these scripts on systems you own or have **explicit written permission** to test. Unauthorised use against systems you do not own is illegal and unethical. The author takes no responsibility for misuse.
